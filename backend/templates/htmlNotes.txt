Layout will be handled by CSS, not markup.
Content is data-driven, not hardcoded visually.

Need to break down our sections from data into HTML plans :
- header
- education
- experience
- projects
- skills

Important for future implementations as :
- pdf renders understand this structure well
- docx translators can walk it more deterministically
- ats systems prefer the clarity

starting with our Default/template.html

we want to begin setting up our placeholder and notes for design.
