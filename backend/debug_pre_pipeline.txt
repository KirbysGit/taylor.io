Experience
Software Engineering Intern May 2024 – June 2025
BitGo | Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, AWS EC2 Remote
• Built and shipped React dashboards and data visualization tools used by product and compliance teams, improving
internal workflow visibility and decision-making.
• Collaborated with design to implement responsive, pixel-perfect UI components aligned with BitGo’s product
guidelines and accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1).
• Integrated Django REST APIs with React components for dynamic updates and real-time state management.
• Collaborated cross-functionally with design and compliance teams to deliver secure, production-grade dashboards
enhancing data visibility and decision-making.
Projects
SentimentTrader – Real-Time Stock Sentiment Pipeline | Python, SQL, FinBERT, XGBoost
• Built data ingestion and NLP pipelines (Python, SQL) processing 1K+ Reddit finance posts per run using FinBERT and
entity resolution to reduce false positives by 85%.
• Engineered 40+ predictive and behavioral features per ticker and trained ML models (XGBoost, FinBERT) achieving
55–70% ROC-AUC.
• Automated end-to-end data collection, preprocessing, and model inference workflows, enabling scalable real-time
analytics.
ShelfVision – Dense Retail Shelf Object Detector | PyTorch, ResNet-50, FPN
• Built a custom anchor-based object detection system (PyTorch, ResNet-50, FPN) for 11K+ dense retail images with
domain-specific anchor tuning.
• Implemented dynamic IoU matching and modular training components, resolving baseline collapse and achieving
measurable convergence (0.0069 mAP, IoU ≈ 0.38).
• Delivered interpretable, production-ready detection pipeline outperforming YOLOv5 baseline in cluttered shelf
environments.
Centi – Personal Finance App | FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Plaid API | https://centi.dev
• Designed RESTful APIs and ETL pipelines integrating Plaid data from 3+ financial sources into normalized PostgreSQL
schemas for account analytics.
• Implemented real-time account insights with optimized SQL queries (↑ 40% query performance) and modular, testable
backend architecture using FastAPI.
• Built responsive React dashboards with OAuth/JWT authentication and CI/CD-based deployments, ensuring 99%
uptime and secure data handling.
SecureScape – Portable Smart Security System | Python, Flutter, Arduino C++, TensorFlow Lite
• Built edge IoT monitoring system with on-device ML (TensorFlow Lite, ESP32-CAM) and Flutter interface for real-time
alerts.
• Designed asynchronous communication layer achieving <3.5 s latency and improving alert accuracy by 25%.
• Implemented fault-tolerant networking and modular backend design ensuring reliable cross-node synchronization.
