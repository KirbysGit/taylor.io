Experience
Software Engineering Intern May 2024 – June 2025
BitGo | Python, Django, React, PostgreSQL, AWS EC2 Remote
• Designed and maintained backend services and REST APIs in Python/Django supporting secure data flows across
internal financial/compliance systems.
• Collaborated with senior engineers on system design, requirements, and architecture, contributing to scalable service
patterns and data modeling.
• Built internal dashboards using React + Django APIs, improving visibility and operational decision-making across
distributed teams.
• Optimized Python data-processing pipelines and PostgreSQL queries, improving system scalability and reducing
latency by ~40%.
Projects
SentimentTrader – Real-Time Stock Sentiment Pipeline | Python, SQL, FinBERT, XGBoost
• Designed and implemented a full ML-driven data pipeline for real-time sentiment analytics, processing 1K+ Reddit
finance posts per run via multi-stage ETL.
• Applied NLP models (FinBERT) and feature engineering to build 40+ predictive features per ticker; trained XGBoost
models achieving 55–70% ROC-AUC.
• Built modular components for data ingestion, transformation, model inference, and distributed-style batching, aligned
with message-driven architectures.
• Automated end-to-end data collection, preprocessing, and model inference workflows, enabling scalable real-time
analytics.
Centi – Personal Finance App | FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Plaid API | https://centi.dev
• Built FastAPI backend services integrating financial data via ETL pipelines and normalized SQL schemas to support real-
time account analytics.
• Implemented scalable API endpoints, caching, and data modeling patterns for high-volume financial transactions.
• Developed React dashboards for insights and authentication; deployed via containerized services and cloud-based
CI/CD.
ShelfVision – Dense Retail Shelf Object Detector | PyTorch, ResNet-50, FPN
• Implemented a custom deep learning object detection pipeline using PyTorch with dynamic IoU matching and modular
training loops.
• Handled large-scale vision datasets (11K+ images) via optimized data loaders and GPU-accelerated training.
• Applied ML engineering workflows including dataset preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, checkpointing, and
analysis.
SecureScape – Portable Smart Security System | Python, Flutter, Arduino C++, TensorFlow Lite
• Designed async communication layers for distributed IoT nodes, ensuring near real-time (<3.5 s) alert propagation and
cross-node synchronization.
• Built fault-tolerant Python backend supporting message handling and system reliability across constrained devices.
